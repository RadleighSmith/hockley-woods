## Planning

### Target Audience:
 
 The Hockley Woods website has been designed to cater several of different target audiences these include:

 * Families

 * Nature enthusiasts

 * Outdoor adventures

 * Dog walkers

 * Runners

 * Hikers

 * Cyclists


 ### Website Aim:

My site aim is to inform local and outside visitors of what Hockley Woods has to offer. I would like visitors to be able to seamlessly navigate around my site whilst being informed of useful information from wildlife to different types of activities that are permitted inside the woods. Whilst achieving this I want to express the important points of enjoying everything on offer whilst remaining respectful to the wildlife, environment and other visitors.

### Colour Scheme:

With the site being designed around nature, I decided early on that I wanted the website to use natural colours, Nothing that would distract the user away from the information but a scheme that clearly depicted that it was designed with the colours of nature in mind.

<img src="docs/readme-images/color-grid.png">

I used http://colormind.io/ to design my colour scheme. I decided to use green (#4c645c) on the header and footer to keep it consistent with white (#ffffff) to contrast against this. I used the slightly off-white (#f3eada) to add a contrasting background and give the impression of depth while the site's information is on the white (#ffffff) background. I used the yellow (#ecba0e) colour on the header to contrast against the green (#4c645c) header to make the support us button stand out to users. 

My goal was to make the site accessible to all, I used https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ to check that my colours contrasted against each other.

<img src="docs/readme-images/colour-contrast-grid.png">


### Wireframes

The design changed during devlopment from the original wireframe plan. The gallery was removed as this is a 'would like feature' and was not imperative for the first launch. The how to find us page was also moved to the home page as this felt more relevent.

How to find us page:

<img src="docs/readme-images/wireframes-find-us.png">

Support us page:

<img src="docs/readme-images/wireframes-support-us.png">

### Typography

Throughout the site I used two different fonts.

* Barlow Semi Condensed: Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family. I used this for section headings.

* Nunito: Nunito is a well balanced, highly-readable sans-serif typeface. I used this for the main body of text.

These fonts were improted to the stylesheet via Google Fonts

## Features

### The Header

The header element is a static element, It is the primary navigation tool for the site. With links to the home, Wildlife, Sports & Recreation, and Support Us! pages. Within my wireframes I originaly designed the title to be above the nav bar. 

<img src="docs/readme-images/wireframes-header.png">

However, I decided against this early on when designing the site as I belived that it would leave to much unused space on the top section and could be distracting to the user. Using flexbox I decided to have the title placed central with the links either side.

<img src="docs/readme-images/header-screenshot.png">

I added the active attribute to aid users in which page they are on and also the hover attribute to the header to give users a positive response.

I wanted to ensure that my site could be accessed by multiple device types and screen sizes. So using media quires I have ensure that the header remains clear and useable down to atleast 320px width.

#### Mobile:

### Home Page

#### Hero Image and Text

I have used a hero image only on the home page to welcome visitors, I have done this to add to the user experience and overall visual appeal. As the hero image is the first thing visitors will see when landing on my site it needed to be relevant while also grabbing their attention immediately, encouraging them to explore further. 

I also used hero text to spark curiosity with users to want to dive deeper into the website. I used contrasting colours with an RGBA background to add transparency so it didn't take complete focus from the hero image itself.

<img src="docs/readme-images/hero-image-screenshot.png">


#### Home page content

The home page excluding the hero image and text is split into 4 sections. Starting with the welcome paragraph and image, this section is focused on inviting the visitor into the website giving a basic overview of Hockley Woods. In this I have include a picture of a woodland during a sunrise, and some basic facts about the woods. I have used information from the local council here and they are credited below. 

<img src="docs/readme-images/welcome-text-screenshot.png">

The next section is a quote, I have used this to space the page out so the user isnt overwhelmed with information.

The next section is a quote, I have used this to space the page out so the user isn't overwhelmed with information. 

<img src= "docs/readme-images/additional-links-screenshot.png">

The last section of the home page before the footer is the 'How to find us' section this includes an interactive google maps, Address, and basic directions from main roads and public transport. I originally planned for this to have its own page but decided that it would be best situated on the home page.

<img src="docs/readme-images/find-us-screenshot.png">

### Wildlife Page

The wildlife page has been designed for visitors who are interested in what they may find whilst visiting the woods. It includes a opening paragraph and a sentence on keeping respectful to the wildlife, I originally planned for the sentence to be placed at the bottom of the page after visitors had read all the content. However, I decided that I wanted this to be above so it cannot be missed as this is one of my aims for the site.

The page has been designed with a flexbox grid with images placed in the small columns and the text in the large columns, using this design made it very easy to add media queries to scale the content for smaller screens. Screens that are 750px wide or less the content will be aligned to the middle with the pictures located above the text.

<img src="docs/readme-images/wildlife-page-screenshot.png">

<img src="docs/readme-images/mobile-wildlife-screenshot.png">

### Sports and Recreation Page

The Sports & Recreation page has been designed for visitors who may be interested in different activities around the woods, it opens with an opening paragraph which is a basic summary of some of the activities. The second part of the page was designed with a flexbox grid which goes into more detail about each of the activities on offer. This page scales very similarly to the wildlife page with screens 630px or smaller.

<img src="docs/readme-images/sports-page-screenshot.png">

<img src="docs/readme-images/mobile-sports-screenshot.png">

### Support us! Page

The support us page informs visitors in a way they could support us, it also includes a form in which users will leave their first and last name along with an email, where we can get in touch personally. I currently have used the code institute landing page to show that it works. However, shortly, I hope to add some back-end structure to the site so this works correctly.

<img src="docs/readme-images/support-us-screenshot.png">

After succesfully completing the form the user will be taken to a thank you page, I implimented this to give the user positive feedback once they completed the form.

<img src="docs/readme-images/thank-you-page-screenshot.png">

### Footer

The footer which is found at the bottom of each page, is used to host our social media links to Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. It also holds an education declaration.

<img src="docs/readme-images/footer-screenshot.png">

### 404 Error Page

I add a 404 error page not found just incase a page doesnt exist so users will be directed to here and can easily navigate to the home page.

<img src="docs/readme-images/404-screenshot.png">

### Future Features

* Interactive Gallery / Photography Page - Allow users to upload images creating a sense of ownership and pride among the community.

* Clubs Page - Allow Clubs to promote themselves to further engage the community and encourage participation

* Condence the header into a drop-down menu when in mobile view using javascript.

* History Page - Showcase the historical importance of Hockley Woods.

* Add back-end structure to the form so data can be managed and sorted.



## Testing

Throughout Development I have tested the site rigorously by using the following devices and applications:

* Macbook Pro 13" Safari, - Chrome and Firefox

* Windows PC (Windows 11) on a 1440p 27" monitor - Chrome, Firefox and Edge

* iPad Air (5th Gen) - Safari and Chrome

* iPad Pro (4th Gen) - Safari and Chrome

* iPhone 13 Pro Max - Safari and Chrome

* iPhone 11 - Safari and Chrome

* Samsung Galaxy Fold - Chrome 


I made use of Google Chrome dev tools to allow to me emulate other devices not a my disposal, I also was able to test it in the responsive dimension in real-time.

### Lighthouse

#### Home page

Desktop testing of home page:

When pushing the Home page through the lighthouse extension I was getting an error with my Map as it was missing a title giving me a score of 97 on my accessibility.

<img src="docs/readme-images/lighthouse-before-fix.png">

<img src="docs/readme-images/lighthouse-map-error.png">

However, after adding a title attribute to the map this error was cleared.

<img src="docs/readme-images/lighthouse-after-fix.png">

Mobile Testing of home page: 

<img src="docs/readme-images/lighthouse-homepage-mobile.png">

The performance score was lower in this test due to the size of the images, however due to this site being designed for desktops and mobile devices the images needed to be larger.

### Validator Testing

#### W3C Validation

I ran all the pages through the validation service with the following results:

Home Page:

When pushing the Home page through the validator I got a warning for not adding a header to the quote section. I have decided not to add a header to this section as I dont think it will aid the user. Other than this it passed no issues.

<img src="docs/readme-images/homepage-w3c-screenshot.png">

Wildlife Page:

Passed no issues

<img src="docs/readme-images/wildlife-w3c-screenshot.png">

#### Jigsaw Validation

When I ran the stylesheet.css through the validatior I got an error for a missing measurement unit.

<img src="docs/readme-images/css-jigsaw-error.png">

After adding the correct mesurement unit the style sheet passed with no issues.

<img src="docs/readme-images/css-jigsaw-fix.png">

### Bugs

* Fixed an issue where all the media queries stoped working due to a typo on the 750px query where the max-width measurement was spelt rpx instead of px.
