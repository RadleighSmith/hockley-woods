## Planning

### Target Audience:
 
 The Hockley Woods website has been designed to cater for a number of different target audiences these include:
 * Families
 * Nature enthusiasts
 * Outdoor adventures
 * Dog walkers
 * Runners
 * Hikers
 * Cyclists

 ### Website Aim:

 The aim of my site is to inform local and outside visitiors of what Hockley Woods has to offer. I would like visitiors to be able to seamlessly navigate around my site whislt being informed of useful information from wildlife to different types of activities that is permitted inside the woods. Whilst achiving this I want to express the important points of enjoying everything on offer whilst remaining respectful to the wildlife, environment and other visitors.

### Colour Scheme:

With the site being designed around nature, I decided early on that I wanted the website to use natural colours, Nothing that would distract the user away from the information but a scheme that clearly depicted that it was designed with the colours of nature in mind.

I used http://colormind.io/ to design my colour scheme. I decided to the use green (#4c645c) on the header and footer to keep it consistant with white (#ffffff) to contrast against this. I used the slightly off white (#f3eada) to add a contrasting background and give the impression on depth while the sites information is on the white (#ffffff) background. I used the yellow (#ecba0e) colour on the header to contrast againt the green (#4c645c) header to make the support us button stand out to users. 

My goal was to make the site as accessible to all, I used https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ to check that my colours contrasted against each other.
