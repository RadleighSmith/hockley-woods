## Planning

### Target Audience:
 
 The Hockley Woods website has been designed to cater for a number of different target audiences these include:
 * Families
 * Nature enthusiasts
 * Outdoor adventures
 * Dog walkers
 * Runners
 * Hikers
 * Cyclists

 ### Website Aim:

 The aim of my site is to inform local and outside visitiors of what Hockley Woods has to offer. I would like visitiors to be able to seamlessly navigate around my site whislt being informed of useful information from wildlife to different types of activities that is permitted inside the woods. Whilst achiving this I want to express the important points of enjoying everything on offer whilst remaining respectful to the wildlife, environment and other visitors.

### Colour Scheme:

With the site being designed around nature, I decided early on that I wanted the website to use natural colours, Nothing that would distract the user away from the information but a scheme that clearly depicted that it was designed with the colours of nature in mind.

I used http://colormind.io/ to design my colour scheme. I decided to the use green (#4c645c) on the header and footer to keep it consistant with white (#ffffff) to contrast against this. I used the slightly off white (#f3eada) to add a contrasting background and give the impression on depth while the sites information is on the white (#ffffff) background. I used the yellow (#ecba0e) colour on the header to contrast againt the green (#4c645c) header to make the support us button stand out to users. 

My goal was to make the site as accessible to all, I used https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ to check that my colours contrasted against each other.

## Features

### The Header

The header element is a static element, It is the primary navigation tool for the site. With links to the home, Wildlife, Sports & Recreation, and Support Us! pages. Within my wireframes I originaly designed the title to be above the nav bar.

However, I decided against this early on when designing the site as I belived that it would leave to much unused space on the top section. Using flexbox I decided to have the title placed central with the links either side.

I added the active attribute to aid users in which page they are on and also the hover attribute to the header to give users a positive response.

I wanted to ensure that my site could be accessed by multiple device types and screen sizes. So using media quires I have ensure that the header remains clear and useable down to atleast 320px width.

### Home Page

#### Hero Image and Text

I have used a hero image only on the home page to welcome visitors, I have done this to add to the user experience and overall visual appeal. As the hero image is the first thing visitors will see when landing on my site it needed to be relevant while also grabbing their attention immediately, encouraging them to explore further. 

I also used hero text to spark curiosity with users to want to dive deeper into the website. I used contrasting colours with a RGBA background to add transparency so it did'nt take complete focus from the hero image itself.
